## Data Visualization
In this project, I used D3.js with React.js to build a scalable and engaging visualization chart. It does include nice interactive features such as ease-in and ease-out animation and tooltip when hovering each bubble. Each bubble represents trading volumn qantity of a cryptocurrency which data are fetched from public API CoinCap API 2.0. I realized how powerful it is to combine two most famous libraries of JavaScript to build a scalable, customizable and appealing data-driven chart in web application. I am hoping to explore more features of D3.js as part of my next side project.
